# AI Agents

Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents are autonomous entities that perceive their environment through sensors and act upon that environment through actuators to achieve specific goals. They can be simple, rule-based systems or complex, learning-based systems that improve their performance over time.

## Key Concepts

*   **Agent:** Anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through actuators.
*   **Percept:** The agent's perceptual inputs at any given instant.
*   **Percept Sequence:** The complete history of everything the agent has ever perceived.
*   **Agent Function:** A function that maps any given percept sequence to an action.
*   **Agent Program:** The implementation of the agent function.

## Types of AI Agents

There are several types of AI agents, including:

*   **Simple Reflex Agents:** These agents select actions based on the current percept, ignoring the rest of the percept history.
*   **Model-Based Reflex Agents:** These agents maintain an internal state to track aspects of the world that are not evident in the current percept.
*   **Goal-Based Agents:** These agents have goal information that describes desirable situations. They can choose actions that will help them achieve their goals.
*   **Utility-Based Agents:** These agents have a utility function that provides a measure of success or happiness for a given state. They choose actions that maximize their expected utility.
*   **Learning Agents:** These agents can learn from their experiences and improve their performance over time.

## This Project: Document Retrieval

This project is a document retrieval system that uses an AI agent to find relevant documents based on a user's query. The agent uses natural language processing (NLP) to understand the query and then searches a database of documents to find the most relevant ones.

## Important Papers and Citations

Here are some important papers and citations related to AI and AI agents:

*   **"Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto:** This book is a comprehensive introduction to reinforcement learning, a type of machine learning that is often used to train AI agents.
*   **"Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville:** This book is a comprehensive introduction to deep learning, a type of machine learning that has been used to achieve state-of-the-art results in many areas of AI.
*   **"Attention Is All You Need" by Ashish Vaswani, et al.:** This paper introduced the Transformer architecture, which has become the foundation for many state-of-the-art NLP models.

## Important Things to Keep in Mind

When working with AI, it is important to keep the following in mind:

*   **Ethics:** AI has the potential to be used for both good and evil. It is important to consider the ethical implications of your work and to use AI in a responsible way.
*   **Bias:** AI models can be biased, just like humans. It is important to be aware of the potential for bias in your models and to take steps to mitigate it.
*   **Safety:** AI systems can be complex and difficult to understand. It is important to design and test your systems carefully to ensure that they are safe and reliable.
*   **Transparency:** It is important to be transparent about how your AI systems work. This will help people to understand and trust them.
